# **Bank Loan Report using Tableau**

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan applications and repayment performance using interactive Tableau dashboards. With banks handling thousands of loan requests daily, analyzing loan distribution, approval rates, and repayment behavior provides valuable insights into risk management, customer profiling, and financial planning.

### Project Overview

Banks deal with diverse loan portfolios across multiple customer segments. Understanding approval trends, loan types, repayment performance, and default risks is critical for decision-making.

The goal of this project is to use Tableau to visualize and analyze bank loan data, enabling stakeholders to identify business insights, reduce risks, and improve loan strategies.

### Problem Statement

Financial institutions face challenges in monitoring and managing loans effectively due to:

High loan volumes across different customer demographics.

Rising defaults and delayed repayments.

Difficulty in tracking loan approval/rejection trends.

Need for a unified reporting system for decision-making.

### Solution

The dataset is analyzed and visualized in Tableau through dashboards that provide:

 Loan distribution and approval analysis.

 Customer segmentation by demographics, geography, and loan type.

 Repayment performance tracking.

 Early identification of high-risk loans.

These insights help banks in portfolio management, customer targeting, and risk mitigation.

### Stages of the Project
#### 1. Data Preparation

Loan data cleaned and structured with fields such as:

Loan ID

Applicant Details (Age, Gender, Income, Employment type, etc.)

Loan Amount

Loan Type (Personal, Home, Auto, etc.)

Status (Approved, Rejected, Defaulted)

Repayment History

#### 2. Exploratory Analysis

Total applications received.

Count of approved vs. rejected loans.

Distribution of loans by type and amount.

Loans by geographic region.

#### 3. Key Insights Dashboards

 Approval Trends – approval rates by year/quarter/month.

 Loan Type Analysis – which loans are most frequently applied for.

 Repayment Behavior – on-time vs. delayed vs. defaulted loans.

 Customer Profile – loan patterns by income group, employment type, and demographics.

#### 4. Risk & Performance Tracking

High-risk customers flagged based on repayment defaults.

Loan performance by region and loan type.

Portfolio health indicators (KPIs).

### Technologies and Tools Used

Visualization Tool: Tableau

Dataset: Bank Loan dataset (applications, approvals, and repayment records)

Data Cleaning: Excel / SQL (depending on preprocessing needs)

### Key Features

 Interactive Tableau dashboards for decision-making.

 Loan approval/rejection tracking with filters.

 Customer segmentation by demographics and income levels.

 Repayment performance monitoring with risk alerts.

 Comprehensive KPIs for loan portfolio health.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Tableau dashboards can be leveraged to:

Track loan applications and approvals.

Analyze repayment performance and defaults.

Provide data-driven insights for bank loan strategies.

Improve risk management and customer targeting.

The framework can be extended to other financial datasets for deeper insights and predictive modeling.
